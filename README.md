# Steps on How to Operate the App

To effectively operate the app, follow these steps:

1. **Read the Instructions**
   - Begin by reading the heading to understand the brief instructions.
2. **Identify Call Buttons**
   - Within the app, you will find call buttons that represent call numbers, which are randomly shuffled.
3. **Locate Order Buttons**
   - Look for order buttons numbered from 1 to 10, arranged in ascending order.
4. **Match Calls with Orders**
   - To make a match, first click on a call button, and then select the position (order) you want to match it with.
5. **Assign Correct Order**
   - Ensure that the smallest call number matches with order 1, the second smallest with order 2, and so on.
6. **Check for Progress**
   - If your match is correct, the Progression Bar will activate, and you will see a corresponding percentage displayed on the right-hand side.
7. **Validation of Correct Matches**
   - The progress will activate only if the match is correct; otherwise, it won't activate.
8. **View Success Status**
   - Once you have successfully matched the correct pairs, the status below the Progression Bar will confirm your success.
9. **Finalize the Matching**
   - To finalize the matching process, click the 'Match The Call' button, and a message confirming the success of the matches will be displayed.
10. **Restart Matching**
    - If you wish to start matching again, simply click the 'Restart' button.

These steps will guide you through operating the app efficiently.
